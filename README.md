# Vue Trends Chart
This technical assessment project is built with a modern frontend stack including Nuxt (for server-side rendering and routing), Vue (as the reactive component framework), Pinia (for state management), TailwindCSS (for utility-first CSS styling), and ApexCharts (for interactive charts). The implementation focuses on performance, maintainability, and a responsive user interface.
